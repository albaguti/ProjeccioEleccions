# ProjeccioEleccions

Project to analyse possible electoral outcome to the Spanish General Elections in Catalonia.

I have projected the result obtained by the catalan parties on the recent municipal polls to the general elections, taking into account several possible escenarios:
<ul>
    <li> Project the plain results obtained on the municipal elections from May 28 to see how would the seats projection look like on each of the Catalana provinces (Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona) 
    </li>
    <li> Project the results obtained on the municipal elections taking into account a possible diferential abstention from the independentist parties (ERC, Junts and CUP)
    </li>
</ul>

On both cases, I compare the projected results with the results obtained in Catalonia on the last General Elections from Nov 2019.
